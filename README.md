This project displays a map and tracks the real time bus route between MIT and Harvard. We can choose different styles of map display as well.

**What I Learned**
- How to use mapbox APIs.
- Rendering a map and placing a marker in particular location on the map.
- Using setTimeout() for continuous movement of the marker on the bus route
- Using different styles of map display
- Adding a highlighter line between distinations along the route.
